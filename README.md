# Coding Challenges Solutions

Welcome to the **Coding Challenges Solutions** repository! This project is part of my self-learning journey to enhance my coding skills by solving various algorithmic and data structure challenges, primarily from LeetCode. All challenges will mostly be solved using **TypeScript**.

## 🧑‍💻 About This Repository

This repository serves as a collection of coding challenges and their solutions, focusing on problem-solving skills, efficient algorithms, and data structure utilization. Each challenge will have detailed explanations of the approach, the reasoning behind the solution, and alternative methods when possible.

### Platform
- **Challenges Source**: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)  
- **Language Used**: TypeScript (Main), but may also include other languages as needed

## 📚 Structure

Challenges are organized into different categories such as arrays, dynamic programming, sorting, etc. Here’s an example of the folder structure:

```
├── arrays/
│   ├── TwoSum.ts
│   ├── README.md
├── recursion/
│   ├── Factorial.ts
│   ├── README.md
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains:
- **Solution files**: Code implementation of the challenges.
- **Explanation (README)**: A markdown file explaining the approach, the logic, and potential alternative solutions.

## 🚀 How to Contribute
